BXXYY corresponds to the birch specimens with a rectangular fracture surface. In addition, the XX denotes from which raw birch piece the specimen was extracted, and the YY denotes the order of which the specimens were extracted. TBXXYY denotes the same for the birch specimens with a triangular fracture surface.

S43XX denotes the spruce specimens with a rectangular fracture surface. In addition, XX denotes the numer of the specimen. Note that for the spruce specimens, all specimens were extracted from the same timber board in sequential order. TS43XX denotes the spruce specimens with a triangular fracture surface, and XX denotes the sequential order in which the specimens were extracted.
